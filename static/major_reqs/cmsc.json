We cover various standard data structures, both abstractly, and in terms of concrete implementations\u2014primarily in C, but also from time to time in other contexts like scheme and ksh. The course uses a team programming approach. There is a mixture of individual programming assignments that focus on current lecture material, together with team programming assignments that can be tackled using any Unix technology. Team projects are assessed based on correctness, elegance, and quality of documentation. We teach the \"Unix way\" of breaking a complex computational problem into smaller pieces, most or all of which can be solved using pre-existing, well-debugged, and documented components, and then composed in a variety of ways",

After learning the basic elements of these languages, we explore functional programming techniques that can be exploited in many areas of application using a surprising variety of languages (e.g., C#, Python) that have included first-class functions as a feature. We compare functional and object oriented programming and include an brief overview of concurrent functional programming in ML and Haskell",

After learning the basic elements of these languages, we explore functional programming techniques that can be exploited in many areas of application using a surprising variety of languages (e.g., C#, Python) that have included first-class functions as a feature. We compare functional and object oriented programming and include an brief overview of concurrent functional programming in ML and Haskell",

Utilizes data-mining as a tool both to understand basic biophysics and to explain protein-ligand associations. Shows how such analog interactions can lead to digital devices (e.g., switches). No biochemistry background will be assumed",

SHORT RANGE

- basic schedule manipulation
  - drag courses once they're on the schedule
    - off schedule (should fly back to bin...)
    - to different quarter
- change the layout so it stays the same as courses are dragged; doesn't look like shit
- persistence w/ localStorage

MEDIUM RANGE

- display num credits?
- add Core objective
- more usability improvements
  - mousing over bin highlights courses in schedule from that bin

LONG RANGE

- more majors; add arbitrary objectives through autocompleting list; remove objectives
- prereq validation
- quarter offered validation
- undo (just because it would be cool)

LONGER RANGE

- more intelligence
  - given where you are, what can you do before graduating? Can I do X before graduating?
- more views
  - Gantt chart?
- more info
  - textbooks?
  - time schedules?
  - instructor evaluations?

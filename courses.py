Certainly  globalizing forces have been especially evident in all parts of China  over the last couple of decades. At the same time, like the rest of East  Asia and the Pacific Rim, China has developed distinctive social,  cultural, and political forms, many of which circulate nationally and  transnationally. This course comes to terms with both the processes of  change that have characterized the last few decades and with a few  recent social and cultural phenomena of interest. Because the scholarly  literature lags behind the pace of transformation in China, we draw on a  wide variety of materials: ethnography, memoir, fiction, films, essays,  historical studies, short stories, websites. Emphasis in class  discussions is on grasping how contemporary Chinese realities are  experienced from viewpoints within China\u2014this is the sense in which the  course is intensive study of a "culture." Readings and materials are  divided into several major units concerned with historical memory, rural  China, urban life, labor migration, and popular culture.

This course is an anthropological exploration of this phenomenon that examines: (1) the use of the ancient past in the construction of modern nationalist mythologies of Celtic identity (e.g., in France and Ireland) and regional movements of resistance to nationalist and colonialist project (e.g., in Brittany, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Gallicia, Asturias); (2) the construction of transnational ethno-nostalgic forms of Celtic identity in modern diasporic communities (Irish, Scottish, etc.); and (3) various recent spiritualist visions of Celticity that decouple the concept from ethnic understandings (e.g., in the New Age and Neo-Pagan movements). All of these are treated in the context of what is known archaeologically about the ancient peoples of Europe who serve as a symbolic reservoir for modern Celtic identities. The course explores these competing Celtic imaginaries in the spaces and media where they are constructed and performed, ranging from museums and monuments, to neo-druid organizations, Celtic cyberspace, Celtic festivals, Celtic theme parks, Celtic music, Celtic commodities, etc',

Yet, science, objectivity, and knowledge have proved resistant to critical analysis. This course is an introduction to thinkers who have withstood this resistance and explores questions about the nature, culture, and politics of scientific knowledge and its production',

Within this broad conceptual umbrella, space, place, and landscape have become critical points of focus for analyzing and interpreting peoples engagement with their physical surroundings. Once an inert backdrop to social life, a mere epiphenomenon, the material world is now perceived as a generative medium and terrain of cultural production: at once socially produced and framing sociality, shaping human actions and understandings while constraining social possibilities. The twin-question is how to go about analyzing the spatial production of social worlds, and how to account for the many different ways in which these processes unfold in varied cultural and historical settings. This course aims to expose you to the contemporary literature on spatial thought and explore various situated approaches to space/place/landscape. We will draw on several fields, anthropology and geography chiefly, but also art history, architecture, philosophy, and social theory, to understand how the triad of space/place/landscape work on, in, and through different social worlds, and their role in the formation of social experience, perception, and imagination.

The origins and value of broad style groupings such as Late Gothic, Early Renaissance, High Renaissance and Mannerism are critically examined, though we concentrate on fewer artists and works rather than attempt a uniform survey of the vast body of material at the core of the Western tradition. We also examine the invention and development of distinctive artistic types and their association with particular moments in history (&quot;sacred conversation&quot; altarpiece, centrally planned church, landscape painting). A major theme of the course is the changing social context for the practice of art and with it the evolving nature of artistic creativity. Where possible, students are asked to supplement their close study of the imagery with contemporary written documents (e.g., contracts, letters, theoretical texts). The ability to talk critically and creatively about text and image is the focus of required biweekly section meetings',

Our subjects will include monuments, landscape and urban design, architecture, mural and easel painting, popular prints and illustration, photography and avant-garde cinema, modern iterations of &quot;craft,&quot; public and private forms of patronage and collecting, and the establishment and aspirations of civic art museums. We will study relationships of artistic production to aesthetic, political, economic, environmental, and religious discourses\u2014asking how those intersections precipitated new visual forms, practices, and iconography; new audiences; rapidly changing definitions of &quot;art&quot; and &quot;artist;&quot; and ongoing efforts to define what is, or should be, &quot;American&quot; in visual art and culture.

There have been profound changes in attitudes and beliefs regarding the nature of photographs throughout the history of photography (this is likewise true of film). The current range of views is very different from those held by the various audiences for photographs and films in the last century and the century before. For instance, photographs were originally conceived of as copies of things that can be seen, but the notion of copy was drawn from a long established set of views about what makes a picture a work of art, and copies were said to be incapable of being works of art. This view continues to haunt the writings of some critics and historians of photography and film.

Organized thematically, this course examines how medieval art and visual culture represented the human (and semi-human) form.

One goal of the course is to examine how medieval representations and peceptions of the human form negotiated various forms of power, desire, fear, and aggression in ways that resemble but also profoundly differ from today',

We will examine a variety of strategies devised to order or replace the metropolis during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, ranging from the City Beautiful movement in Chicago, Camillo Sitte\u2019s influential critique of Vienna\u2019s Ringstrasse, and the English garden city alternative Lewis Mumford championed for the New York region, to Le Corbusier\u2019s Plan Voisin for Paris, and Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s Broadacre City model displayed in New York\u2019s Rockefeller Center.

As a result, the city itself has come to occupy a mythic position as a central hub of Western intellectual culture: uprooted from its geographical specificity by the circulation of such proper names as Machiavelli, Leonardo, Michelangelo, and unmoored from its historical heritage by the disorienting complexities of modern mass tourism. Therefore, this course seeks to re-integrate the \u201cRenaissance\u201d into the urban context from which it emerged, to defamiliarize it so that it can be looked at from other perspectives. It focuses on the city itself as the protagonist of some of the most important experiments in art, architecture, and urban development and shows how they were intimately connected to a lively and engaged social body. By approaching images and monuments through the spatial practices by which they were encountered by Renaissance society (rituals of conflict, contests, economic exchange, religious devotion, urban politics, identity formation, among others), students will gain a more nuanced understanding of the links between a localized urban culture and a larger intercultural and cross-temporal exchange of ideas. Rather than diminishing the cultural achievements of its artistic giants, or de-legitimating the rich, varied, and sophisticated intellectual heritage of Renaissance scholarship, this course works toward a critical dialogue between historiography, the historical monument, and the urban context',

We trace how the city informs documentary, educational, industrial, narrative feature, and avant-garde films. If there is a Chicago style of filmmaking, one must look at the landscape of the city; and the design, politics, cultures, and labor of its people, as well as how they live their lives. The protagonists and villains in these films are the politicians and community organizers, our locations are the neighborhoods, and the set designers are Mies van der Rohe and the Chicago Housing Authority',

We discuss this assumption in terms of the break-up of the studio system; the erosion of the Production Code; the crisis of audience precipitated by television\'s mass spread; and the changing modes of film reception, production, and style under the impact of video, cable, and other electronic communication technologies. We also relate cinema to social and political issues of the post-1960s period and ask how films reflected upon and intervened in contested areas of public and private experience. With the help of the concept of "genre" (and the changed "genericity" of 1980s and 1990s films) and of the notion of "national cinema" (usually applied to film traditions other than the United States), we attempt a dialogue between industrial/stylistic and cultural-studies approaches to film history',

Neorealism thus became a model for the renewal of cinemas everywhere, binding a new ethic and aesthetic of filmmaking in ways that remain exemplary for other nations and minorities to this day. In its renewed exploration of space and location, temporality and history, neorealism was also a central reference for artists, architects, and writers. This course will interlace key neorealist feature films with lesser known works, including documentaries and shorts, offering fresh perspectives on one of the most influential movements in film history.

This Italian "New Wave," distinct from its French counterpart, responded to a host of political and cultural imperatives through new visions of urban space, of social and sexual mores, the relation of "high" and "low," and revisitations of the past both near and distant.

In an era of reflexive, ironic post-classical cinema, it sometimes seemed as though he sought to ignore film history altogether, to defy its habits and conventions \u2013 to re-invent the medium in his own terms. Yet Bresson delves deeply into questions of cinema as a mode of perception, of knowledge and belief, as a way to explore social being and singularity: the individual inextricably, often tragically bound in the transactions of modern life. In this course we will consider Bresson\u2019s sources, his modes of narration, the relation of text and image, visual style and sound practice; we will seek to define the special mode of attention that his films command.

Meanwhile, throughout its history, the motion-picture medium has shown an affinity with the city as an audio-visual ensemble, which in turn has provided constant inspiration for cinematic experimentation.

It has been applied equally to religious cinema and to the experimental avant-garde. Our task will be to interrogate this concept and to try to define what it actually is denoting. Films and critical texts will mainly be drawn from Soviet and French cinema of the 1920s-1930s and 1960s-1990s. Directors include Dovzhenko, Renoir, Cocteau, Resnais, Maya Deren, Tarkovsky, Pasolini, Jarman, and Sokurov. In addition to sampling these directors\' own writings, we shall examine theories of poetic cinema by major critics from the Russian formalists to Andre Bazin beyond',

The connection between cinema and symbolism was not surprising insofar as symbolism was a dominant aesthetic paradigm throughout Europe at the time. However it does suggest (perhaps surprisingly) that from the very beginning cinema was seen as a means of visualizing the non-rational, uncanny and even invisible. This course examines the relationship between symbolism and cinema with particular attention to French and Russian writings and films. Examining how symbolist aesthetics became applied to the cinematic medium, we will pay particular attention the resources it provided for conceptualizing the uncanny and the mystical. We will question whether there exists a distinct symbolist tradition in film history and how it relates to notions of poetic or experimental cinema. Films will represent a broad cross-section of European (and some American) cinema, from Jean Epstein to Sergei Eisenstein and Alexander Dovzhenko, and from Stan Brakhage to Andrei Tarkovsky',

Many would argue yes.\xa0 It is widely accepted that in modern societies romantic love, the couple and the nuclear family are the "correct" ways to organize intimate life.\xa0 But, like many other normative ideas, these too were the product of particular historical developments in post-enlightenment Europe.\xa0 A look at societies in other parts of the world demonstrates all too often that modernity in the realm of love, intimacy and family had a different trajectory from the European one. To characterize marriage, love, and familial relationships as backward or retrograde on grounds of their difference with (normative) models prevalent in the west results in a fundamental misunderstanding of the variety of different ways that societies have forged intimate relations.\xa0 This course surveys ideas and practices surrounding love, marriage, and capital in the modern world with a particular focus on comparison between Africa and India.\xa0 The first half of the class concentrates on key theoretical texts that lay the foundation for the study of gender, intimacy and modern life. The latter part of the class examines case studies from Africa and India.\xa0 Using a range of readings the course will explore such questions as the emergence of companionate marriage in Europe; arranged marriage, dowry, love and money.

We compare the conceptual categories through which these films make sense of the world, especially the sense of humor with which they come to terms with that world.

We stress a variety of traditional theoretical concerns of the broader Mesoamerican region stressed (e.g., the validity of reconstructive ethnography; theories of agrarian community structure; religious revitalization movements; the constitution of such identity categories as indigenous, Mayan, and Yucatecan). In this respect, the course can serve as a general introduction to the anthropology of the region.

Through what languages and aesthetic procedures did it help foster patriotic sentiments and identifications? Was poetry a disciplinary tool for the formation of notions of citizenship and of civic values? Through a series of close textual readings, we will investigate the nature of the entanglement between the poetical and the demands of the political and inquire if there were moments when this relationship proved to be traversed by frictions, if not impossibilities.

In the late eighteenth century, many revolutionary Spaniards and Spanish Americans travelled throughout the Atlantic world seeking to make the philosophy of equality a reality and gain independence of the Spanish colonies. They travelled to and from Europe and Spanish America; and on to New Orleans, Charleston, Washington DC, Philadelphia, and New York. Through their voyages, these individuals would bring this new political language of rights to the places they visited, imbibing of this political philosophy by reading and through conversations and discussions. They produced, as well, a plethora of publications and writings that circulated throughout the Atlantic world. Through lecture and discussion, students in this interdisciplinary course learn of these individuals, their circuits of travel, and their desire to create a modern world. Our focus is on the communities, individuals, and texts that were published and circulated in what is today the United States.

These movements on one level represent conscious breaks with an immediate negative past, and they anticipate a positive future in which present sources of oppression are overcome. Many contemporary Native American movements, political and/or religious, can be understood as sharing similar dynamics to past movements. We examine classic accounts of the Ghost Dance, often considered to be the prototypical Native American religious movement; the analysis of the Handsome Lake religion among the Senecas; and other Native American religious movements',

We cover the basic approaches sociologists have employed to understand the causes and consequences of inequality in the United States, with a focus on class, race, gender, and neighborhood. We begin by briefly discussing the main theoretical perspectives on inequality, which were born of nineteenth century efforts by sociologists to understand modernization in Europe. Then, turning to contemporary American society, we examine whether different forms of inequality are persisting, increasing, or decreasing\u2014and why. Topics include culture, skills, discrimination, preferences, the family, and institutional processes, addressing both the logic behind existing theories and the evidence (or lack thereof) in support of them',

Public policies intended to maintain and strengthen traditional racial relationships have included forced relocation, apartheid, extermination, walls, institutionalization, incarceration, segregation, ethnic cleansing, and legislated discrimination. Public policies intended to upset such traditions have included forced busing, affirmative action, the reservation of opportunities and political positions for specific castes/religions/ethnicities, and the legislated illegality of discrimination in housing and employment. Most recently in the United States, through distraction, hopelessness, indifference, neglect, the absence of good ideas, and/or the inability of advocates to compete effectively in the policy landscape, public policy has little to say about race. Even an African-American president has declined to offer policy initiatives in this area. This course will examine public policy attempts to address issues of race, explore why so many seem to contain the seeds of their own failure, and formulate potential race policies that could jump start the contemporary policy conversation in this area. The course will include a research component exploring the current status of race policy in Chicago and Hyde Park',

This idea leads to great power of expression while maintaining simplicity, making it easier to write correct and maintainable software. We use the languages Haskell and ML as representatives of the two main schools of functional programming, the pure and the impure. After learning the basic elements of these languages, we explore functional programming techniques that can be exploited in many areas of application using a surprising variety of languages (e.g., C#, Python) that have included first-class functions as a feature. We compare functional and object oriented programming and include an brief overview of concurrent functional programming in ML and Haskell',

We will look not only at the methodology of oral history interviewing but also at the interface of written and oral cultures: who wrote, and why? What was written down and what is not? How did transcription and ritualized retelling affect memory? We will look at the numerous collections and sound recordings of oral texts and memories produced in twentieth century China: recorded folk songs and folk stories in the Republican era; the Maoist \u201cFour Histories\u201d of families, villages, communes, and factories; the memoir literature of the 1980s; the systematic cataloging and appropriation of local \u201ccultural heritage\u201d in the last decade.

If we want to understand what socialism meant for different groups of people, we have to look at the "new objects" of\xa0 socialist modernity, at changes in dress codes and apartment layouts, at electrification and city planning. We have to analyze workplaces and labor processes in order to understand how socialism changed the way people worked. We also have to look at the rationing of consumer goods and its effects on people\'s daily lives. The course has a strong comparative dimension: we will look at the literature on socialism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, to see how Chinese socialism differed from its cousins. Another aim is methodological. How can we understand the lives of people who wrote little and were rarely written about? To which extent can we read people\'s life experiences out of material objects?',

We also study what many consider the current and ongoing form of nuclear war in the widespread deployment of depleted uranium in war zones and military bases\u2014and its contested impact on civilians, soldiers, spouses, and children. In this examination, we compare nuclear bombing with other forms of bombing, on the one hand, and with its putative peaceful use as a source of energy',

Emily Bront\xeb\u2019s Wuthering Heights (1847), set on the open moors of turn-of-the-century Yorkshire\u2014another country for urban readers from London and the south\u2014uses its representations of national otherness to portray the uneasy relations between center and periphery, native and other, as a state of perpetual potential revolution between antagonists: of genre (domestic versus gothic fiction), geography and culture (south/north, civilized/wild, metropolitan/provincial, English/other), and language, gender, and class. Charles Dickens\u2019s Bleak House (1852-3), set in mid-Victorian London, explores many of the same apparent divides by focusing on London\u2019s internal others: the slums that surround and threaten its legal and domestic centers, the alien inhabitants at the metropolitan heart. To more fully contextualize these central fictions in the literary and visual landscapes of Victorians at mid-century, we will use selected poetry, non-fiction, and visual arts together with site visits to London museums and neighborhoods and an optional day trip to Haworth in Yorkshire. (The group's 4-day trip earlier in the quarter to Cornwall and Devon should also provide occasion to think about center-periphery relationships.)

Then we will turn to the extraordinary revival of interest in the legend that started with the Victorians and which has continued almost unabated to the present. In our discussions we will consider such matters as the various political uses that have been made of the legend as well as some of the reasons for its enduring popularity. Early in the course we will visit sites traditionally associated with King Arthur, including Tintagel Castle and St. Michael\u2019s Mount on Cornwall and Glastonbury Abbey and Cadbury Castle in Somerset. Later won we will examine nineteenth-century visual representations of the legend in London collections, most obviously the Tate gallery.

We will interpret \u201cscience\u201d broadly to include major developments such as theories of evolution and heredity in biology and the atomic theory in physics, as well as branches of research that are now either discredited or entirely transformed: phrenology, physiognomy, degeneration, biogenetic recapitulation, atavism, mesmerism, moral management, sexology, and hysteria. Our aim will be to examine the role of literature in its relations with science: What possibilities for imagining the implications of scientific theories do literary works offer that may be unavailable in nonfiction prose? Beyond addressing science thematically, how does literature respond formally, for example reimagining structures such as \u201ccharacter\u201d or genres such as the bildungsroman in light of biological and psychological explanations of how humans think, reason, and develop? As we explore these questions within a particular historical context, we will consider how recent critics have offered theoretical justifications for and modes of relating science and literature.

They travelled to and from Europe and Spanish America; and on to New Orleans, Charleston, Washington DC, Philadelphia, and New York. Through their voyages, these individuals would bring this new political language of rights to the places they visited, imbibing of this political philosophy by reading and through conversations and discussions. They produced, as well, a plethora of publications and writings that circulated throughout the Atlantic world. Through lecture and discussion, students in this interdisciplinary course learn of these individuals, their circuits of travel, and their desire to create a modern world. Our focus is on the communities, individuals, and texts that were published and circulated in what is today the United States. We begin with the late eighteenth century and work our way through the nineteenth century. Classes conducted in English; most texts in English',

This course is designed to provide students with guidance on the models and tools needed to conduct an economic research study on the intersecting topics of environment, agriculture, and food. Students learn how to develop original research ideas using a quantitative and applied economic policy analysis for professional and scholarly audiences. Students collect, synthesize, and analyze data using economic and statistical tools. Students provide outcomes and recommendations based on scholarly, objective, and policy relevant research rather than on advocacy or opinions, and produce a final professional-quality report for a workshop presentation and publication.

The Great Lakes are possibly the world's most valuable freshwater ecosystem, while the Kankakee marshes previously supported a massive diversity and abundance of waterfowl and other native species. Since European colonization most of the marshes of the Calumet region have been drained for agriculture, urbanization, or to create new land for industry. All remaining freshwater ecosystems in the Calumet region, including Lake Michigan, have been affected by invasive species, chemical pollution, overfishing, and numerous other factors. This course examines the history of impacts on the extent and functioning of freshwater ecosystems in the Calumet region. Particular attention is paid to the pre-European state of Calumet freshwaters, the impacts of land-use change and invasive species, and the prospects for restoration. The entire course is framed within the context of the economic conditions that allowed freshwater habitats in the Calumet region to be so strongly modified and how current economic conditions affect the likely future of these ecosystems",

In this course we shall read and analyze in detail her novels and essays, and consider the earlier and more recent critical reception of her corpus. We shall also consider her influence on subsequent writers, and the ways in which her poetics and practice interact in important ways with feminist, queer, and political theories of current interest. Given that her major novels are translated into English, the course is open to non-specialists of Italian literature, although students concentrating on Italian literature will read the original versions',

In this course, we will be following this medieval curriculum insofar as we are able through some of its primary texts, many only recently translated, so as to come to a better appreciation of the way in which the study of these arts affected the development of medieval European intellectual and artistic culture',

In the late eighteenth century, many revolutionary Spaniards and Spanish Americans travelled throughout the Atlantic world seeking to make the philosophy of equality a reality and gain independence of the Spanish colonies. They travelled to and from Europe and Spanish America; and on to New Orleans, Charleston, Washington DC, Philadelphia, and New York. Through their voyages, these individuals would bring this new political language of rights to the places they visited, imbibing of this political philosophy by reading and through conversations and discussions. They produced, as well, a plethora of publications and writings that circulated throughout the Atlantic world. Through lecture and discussion, students in this interdisciplinary course learn of these individuals, their circuits of travel, and their desire to create a modern world. Our focus is on the communities, individuals, and texts that were published and circulated in what is today the United States.

It encourages students to think about the ways in which Mumbai\u2019s past and present patterns of urban informality, capitalism, consumption, criminality and urban dislocations mediate very particular experiences of politics, sociality, class, gender and globalization.

From the late eighteenth century Sexologists to the so-called \u201cpost-Queer Theory\u201d movement today, these theorists have continued a process if refining and redefining what sexuality means. More importantly, these theorists have worked and continue to work to understand how sexuality means. It is this process that we will track in this course, with a special eye to the reinvention of earlier work by later theorists. In this, I wish for us to discover how the Queer Theory of today, despite its many differences from turn of the century Sexology, can be seen as participating in the same discussion of Sexology, and indeed can be seen not as a reinterpretation of that work but a continuation of it. In part, then, this course serves as an overview of the long history of Queer Theory, and we will therefore be reading several of the more seminal works of the 120+ years of sexuality studies',

From the late 1940s to her death, her works stimulated numerous critical debates, but she remained fundamentally an \u201coutsider\u201d whose art could not find a comfortable place in the prevailing niches into which her more \u201cinsider\u201d contemporaries were placed. In this course we shall read and analyze in detail her novels and essays, and consider the earlier and more recent critical reception of her corpus. We shall also consider her influence on subsequent writers, and the ways in which her poetics and practice interact in important ways with feminist, queer, and political theories of current interest. Given that her major novels are translated into English, the course is open to non-specialists of Italian literature, although students concentrating on Italian literature will read the original versions',

How did nineteenth- and early\u2013twentieth-century "sojourners" become "citizens?" What constituted the public\'s shift in perception of Asians from unassimilable alien to ostensible "model minority?" We interrogate not only what it means to have been and to be an Asian in America but also what role Asian Americans have played in striving for a multiracial democracy. Conscious of the tendency to homogenize all Asians in the historical imagination, the course is explicitly comparative, incorporating the diverse and disparate experiences of East, Southeast, and South Asians, as well as Pacific Islanders in America. We also investigate and compare the histories of African Americans, Native Americans, ethnic whites, Latinas/os, and Arab Americans to highlight the Asian American experience',

If we want to understand what socialism meant for different groups of people, we have to look at the "new objects" of socialist modernity, at changes in dress codes and apartment layouts, at electrification and city planning. We have to analyze workplaces and labor processes in order to understand how socialism changed the way people worked. We also have to look at the rationing of consumer goods and its effects on people\'s daily lives. The course has a strong comparative dimension: we will look at the literature on socialism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, to see how Chinese socialism differed from its cousins. Another aim is methodological. How can we understand the lives of people who wrote little and were rarely written about? To which extent can we read people\'s life experiences out of material objects?',

We will look not only at the methodology of oral history interviewing but also at the interface of written and oral cultures: who wrote, and why? What was written down and what is not? How did transcription and ritualized retelling affect memory? We will look at the numerous collections and sound recordings of oral texts and memories produced in twentieth century China: recorded folk songs and folk stories in the Republican era; the Maoist \u201cFour Histories\u201d of families, villages, communes, and factories; the memoir literature of the 1980s; the systematic cataloging and appropriation of local \u201ccultural heritage\u201d in the last decade.

In referring to that history, we treat a variety of themes, including: migration and its impact, origins and effects of class stratification; relation of culture and cultural endeavor to collective consciousness, rise of institutionalized religions, facts and fictions of political empowerment, and the correspondence of Black lives and living to indices of city wellness (service, schools, safety, general civic feeling). This is a history class that situates itself within a robust interdisciplinary conversation. Students can expect to engage works of autobiography and poetry, sociology, documentary photography, and political science as well as more straightforward historical analysis. By the end of the class, students should have grounding in Black Chicago's history, as well as an appreciation of how this history outlines and anticipates Black life and racial politics in the modern United States",

The focus will be on baseball as a professional sport, with more attention devoted to the early history of the game than to the recent era. Emphasis will be on using baseball as a historical lens through which we will analyze the development of American society rather than on the celebration of individuals or teams.

We ask whether human rights has or needs philosophical foundations, what we need such foundations for, and where they might be found. We also ask some questions that tend to generate the search for philosophical foundations: Are human rights universal or merely the product of particular cultures? What kinds of rights (e.g., political, cultural, economic, negative, positive) are human rights? Can there be human rights without human duties? Without universal enforcement?

We will start with the present conundrum of human rights: a surfeit of human rights law, nationally and internationally, and an actual lack of rights for individuals and people; the proliferation of humanitarian activism and the suspicion that it will not alleviate misery and provide succor. The discussion of the present will lead us to wonder when, where, and for whom human rights and, for that matter, humanitarianism provide actual solutions to real-life problems \u2013 and what these problems might be. We will also explore the passions that motivated people to pursue human rights and the empathy that led them to uproot injustice \u2013 and what this passion did and did not achieve. The revolutionary challenges to national and international society in the late eighteenth and in the mid twentieth century will be the two pivots of this inquiry. But we will also spend a good deal of time wondering about the curious absence of human rights and in the midst of the proliferation of humanitarian good will in moments of imperialism. This, in turn, will gives us plenty of material to return to the present and to come to some informed conclusions, where we stand today in terms of human rights',

Experts must meet many familiar standards for successful writing: clear style, logical organization, and persuasive argument. But because they work with specialized knowledge, experts also face particular writing difficulties: they must be clear about complexities and specific about abstractions; they must use uncomplicated organization for very complicated ideas; they must create straightforward logic for intricate arguments; they must be concise but not incomplete, direct but not simplistic; they must clarify the obscure but not repeat the obvious; and they must anticipate the demands of aggressively skeptical readers. The seminars do not repeat or extend the substantive discussion of the Humanities class; they use the discussions and assignments from those classes as a tool for the advanced study of writing. We study various methods not only for the construction of sophisticated and well-structured arguments but also for understanding the complications and limits of those arguments. These seminars also address issues of readership and communication within expert communities.

The exercises address the creative efforts of students, and the reading segments are longer and more challenging in both style and content.

Jews have had a unique political history: for the majority of Jewish history, Jews have not been a sovereign nation. As a result of this history of statelessness, Jewish thinkers have approached political questions in ways that differ from the mainstream of Western political theory. In this course, we will survey the different genres in which Jewish thinkers have addressed political questions, and we will explore what these thinkers have to say about power, authority, law, obligation, community, and national sovereignty. Readings will include selections from the Bible; Midrash; Halachah; medieval and modern philosophy (Maimonides, Spinoza); arguments for and against Zionism; and Israeli constitutional law',

They travelled to and from Europe and Spanish America; and on to New Orleans, Charleston, Washington DC, Philadelphia, and New York. Through their voyages, these individuals would bring this new political language of rights to the places they visited, imbibing of this political philosophy by reading and through conversations and discussions. They produced, as well, a plethora of publications and writings that circulated throughout the Atlantic world. Through lecture and discussion, students in this interdisciplinary course learn of these individuals, their circuits of travel, and their desire to create a modern world.

The evolution of liberal thought coincided and intersected with the rise of European empires, and those empires have been shaped by liberal preoccupations, including ideas of tutelage in self-government, exporting the rule of law, and the normativity of European modernity. Some of the questions this course will address include: how was liberalism, an apparently universalistic and egalitarian theory, used to legitimate conquest and imperial domination? Is liberalism inherently imperialist? Are certain liberal ideas and doctrines (progress, development, liberty) particularly compatible with empire? What does, or what might, a critique of liberal imperialism look like? Readings will include historical works by authors such as Mill, Tocqueville, and Hobson, as well as contemporary works of political theory and the history of political thought (by authors such as James Tully, Michael Ignatieff, David Kennedy, and Uday Mehta).

The overarching theme is understanding what varieties of language structure and use are found across the world's languages and cultures, and what limitations on this variety exist",

In what ways does spoken language differ from signed language? What features make spoken and signed language linguistic? What features distinguish linguistic means of communication from animal communication? How do humans communicate with animals? From an evolutionary point of view, how can we account for the fact that spoken language is the dominant mode of communication in all human communities around the world?

Then we will turn to the extraordinary revival of interest in the legend that started with the Victorians and which has continued almost unabated to the present. In our discussions we will consider such matters as the various political uses that have been made of the legend as well as some of the reasons for its enduring popularity. Early in the course we will visit sites traditionally associated with King Arthur, including Tintagel Castle and St. Michael\u2019s Mount on Cornwall and Glastonbury Abbey and Cadbury Castle in Somerset. Later won we will examine nineteenth-century visual representations of the legend in London collections, most obviously the Tate gallery.

After the sack of Baghdad in 1258, the eastern half of the Islamic world was incorporated into a Mongol world empire stretching from China to Eastern Europe. Along with a brutally imposed new world order came new visual forms, such as the phoenix; as well as shifts in patronage patterns, evidenced by the rise of women patrons. Conquerors and the conquered negotiated their positions vis-\xe0-vis each other through the arts, and rival Turko-Mongol princes vied to attract the best artists to their courts. The vibrancy of this period was universally acknowledged under subsequent Islamic dynasties. Later writers traced the origins of Persian manuscript painting tradition to the early fourteenth century, and later courts positioned themselves as heirs of the Timurid artistic legacy',

This course is a survey of the history of the Iranian film industry and Iranian cinema as a national cinema\u2014including major directors, genres, and trends\u2014from the 1970s to the present. Our emphasis is on situating films in the historical, political, social, and economic context of modern Iranian society, both prior to and after the revolution of 1979. In addition to analyzing the films as artistic constructs and as the works of particular auteurs, we consider such larger questions as how the political and intellectual history of modern Iran is reflected in its films; the extent to which Iranian cinema is a national cinema, a &quot;third-world&quot; cinema, or part of &quot;world cinema&quot;; whether Iranian film has developed a &quot;grammar&quot; and style of its own; and revolutionary uses of cinema, censorship, gender, and so forth',

We focus on the problems of Orientalism, Balkanism, and nesting orientalisms, as well as on self-mythologization and self-exoticization. We also think about differing models of masculinity and of the figure of the gypsy as a metaphor for the national self in relation to the West. The course concludes by considering the role that the imperative to belong to Western Europe played in the Yugoslavian wars of the 1990s',

We likewise explore the ways in which archeologists, historians, novelists, and artists emphasized the connectivity between past and present, and the channels through which their new ideas were transmitted. The class thus highlights phenomena like nationalism, reform, and literary and print capitalism (in both Hebrew and Arabic) as experienced in the Middle East',

We will first engage with some reports from torture victims, and look briefly at contemporary torture practices, and how torture is defined in international law. Then we will turn to study a large part of the recent academic literature about torture. This literature is authored both by moral philosophers and by academics in other fields, such as political theory, history and law. However, our focus, or \u201ctake\u201d on the readings, will be specifically moral-philosophical. The course has two central aims. Firstly, to bring analytical precision and rigour to the concept of torture itself: sharpening our understanding of torture as distinctive kind of act, or practice \u2013 i.e. getting clearer on what torture is; and pinning down the unique form of violation or harm that torture constitutes \u2013 i.e. understanding how, why and to what extent, torture is a form of harm, violation or wrongdoing. Secondly, we will use the literature on this topic as a lens through which to see clearly the influence of some important moral theories \u2013 their assumptions, methods and approaches \u2013 on contemporary thinking about torture, both within moral philosophy and in the wider intellectual sphere. This will be achieved through close critical analysis of some characteristic lines of response to perhaps the most pressing question about torture that we have faced in recent years: Is interrogational torture ever morally permissible? I hope that the course will allows students to clarify and refine their own understanding of, and perspective on, torture in the world today, and to gain a sense of the lay of the land in contemporary moral philosophy, so that they can locate their perspective within the discipline',

                  'desc': u"Twentieth century Anglophone philosophy took a decisive turn with the development of distinctively analytic approaches to philosophical issues. This turn had a profound impact on moral philosophy. The study of thought, logic, language, and the like was intended to carry forward a study of reason as it took shape in the work of Immanuel Kant. Such efforts coincided nicely with philosophical work on knowledge and objects of knowledge, on facts, and so on\u2014topics belonging to so-called theoretical reason. Ethics, however, was somehow about value. How could that subject belong to a study of reason? In what sense was ethics objective rather than subjective? More generally, given widespread dissatisfaction with going accounts of practical (rather than theoretical) reason, what was the connection between reason and morality? The problem was made especially acute by three aspects of distinctively moral philosophy carried forward under the new analytical regime: (1) An account of morality that had it that morality (a) concerned action, and (b) involved a kind of reason for acting that enjoined agents directly, rather than via their goals, plans, projects, tastes, interests or other personal qualities; (2) An insistence that practical philosophy was accountable to its own &quot;first-order,&quot; that is that a moral theory that could not show what was wrong with slavery, say, or torture or rape or murder was, for that very reason, unsound; and (3) Stalwart adherence to a certain methodological individualism in ethics, even among those philosophers in search of a (more or less) systematic, analytical practical philosophy\u2014by these lights, showing what is wrong with, say, torture or slavery requires showing how there are good reasons to refrain from engaging in such activities, reasons that are accessible to any mature human being in possession of her or his powers who has her or his wits about him. The first and second aspects look promising for analytical ethics. The focus on morality in particular, rather than on more general questions about how one should live, looked to undercut the apparent subjective taint of work on value and action. The focus on reasons likewise looked to draw philosophers toward publicly accessible aspects of their topics, because it isn't at all clear that any strictly subjective consideration could ever serve as a reason for acting or for belief. Reasons are inherently communicable and open to public assessment. The third aspect, however\u2014an aspect that seems to belong to any study of matters pertaining to intentional action (for reasons we'll discuss)\u2014looks to force a distinctively &quot;subjective&quot; focus onto moral theory. We will examine a series of philosophical forays into the perilous terrain of making room for moral philosophy in the larger, analytically-inflected field of work on thought, knowledge, and, more generally, reason, in light of these three aspects of moral philosophy.

Is the legitimate exercise of political power limited by our pre-political rights, especially our property rights? Indeed, is the sole function of a just government to safeguard such rights? We will work towards answers to these questions by evaluating the tradition in political philosophy that has tended to answer them in the affirmative\u2014Libertarianism. We will begin with John Locke, the father of this tradition, devoting several weeks to a close reading of his Second Treatise of Government. We will attend to both his method and his substantive political conclusions. We will consider his distinctive use of a social contract thought experiment involving a moralized conception of practical reason, as well as his defense of private property and limited government. We will then consider the works of contemporary Libertarians such as Robert Nozick and Michael Otsuka who take inspiration from Locke\u2019s method but diverge sharply from one another in their political conclusions. Finally, we will consider contemporary critics of the entire tradition, such as G.A. Cohen, and consider the merits of alternative approaches within the social contract tradition. (A)',

But the study of history and of distant communities appears to show that we may be separated by a much deeper sort of gulf: we may inhabit different conceptual schemes. What one person regards as true (or false) may be simply unintelligible to the other person; the two persons may reason according to different norms; they may see facts and be responsive to values that are simply invisible to the other; in the most radical cases, they seem to live in different worlds. According to some thinkers, the recognition of this sort of conceptual distance leads inevitably into conceptual relativism. Truth and correctness, they argue, is possible only within a given conceptual scheme. The constitutive norms of each conceptual scheme define what counts as \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201ccorrect\u201d within the framework; but the choice between different schemes is beyond the reach of rational assessment. The adoption of a new conceptual scheme is, rationally speaking, a leap into the void: it can be induced and achieved by means of \u201cpersuasion\u201d and \u201cconversion\u201d (conceived as a-rational processes), but cannot be the result of a rational discussion. However, there are strong reasons to resist this form of relativism. Is there a way to do full justice to the phenomenon of conceptual change and conceptual distance, without falling into conceptual relativism? This is the guiding question of this class. In the first part of the course, we will discuss some examples of conceptual change taken from the history of the natural sciences (T. Kuhn), anthropology (P. Winch), the history of the human sciences (I. Hacking), and the history of psychiatry (A. Davidson). In the second part of the course, we will discuss a defense of conceptual relativism (R. Rorty). In the third and last part, we will examine the views of a number of contemporary philosophers who seek to resist conceptual relativism while doing full justice to the radical character of conceptual change (S.

We will study a range of classical and contemporary theories about the semantics of referring expressions such as proper names, definite descriptions, and indexicals. Readings will include Frege, Russell, Strawson, Kripke, Donnellan, and Kaplan, among others. Throughout, we will try to reach of a better understanding of how questions about meaning and reference connect with a range of topics that are central to philosophical theorizing, including the connection between propositional attitudes and the explanation of action, the role of the principle of compositionality in formal semantics, the question of whether there is a level of mental experience that is epistemically transparent, the relation between thought and language, the nature of fictional and non-existent objects, and the interaction between semantics and pragmatics.

In addition, some prominent theories of the limits of law make reference to emotions: thus Lord Devlin and, more recently, Leon Kass have argued that the disgust of the average member of society is a sufficient reason for rendering a practice illegal, even though it does no harm to others. Emotions, however, are all too rarely studied closely, with the result that both theory and doctrine are often confused. The first part of this course will study major theories of emotion, asking about the relationship between emotion and cognition, focusing on philosophical accounts, but also learning from anthropology and psychology. We will ask how far emotions embody cognitions, and of what type, and then we will ask whether there is reason to consider some or all emotions \u201cirrational\u201d in a normative sense. We then turn to the criminal law, asking how specific emotions figure in doctrine and theory: anger, fear, compassion, disgust, guilt, and shame. Legal areas considered will include self-defense, reasonable provocation, mercy, victim impact statements, sodomy laws, sexual harassment, shame-based punishments. Next, we turn to the role played by emotions in constitutional law and in thought about just institutions\u2014a topic that seems initially unpromising, but one that will turn out to be full of interest.

The evolution of liberal thought coincided and intersected with the rise of European empires, and those empires have been shaped by liberal preoccupations, including ideas of tutelage in self-government, exporting the rule of law, and the normativity of European modernity. Some of the questions this course will address include: how was liberalism, an apparently universalistic and egalitarian theory, used to legitimate conquest and imperial domination? Is liberalism inherently imperialist? Are certain liberal ideas and doctrines (progress, development, liberty) particularly compatible with empire? What does, or what might, a critique of liberal imperialism look like? Readings will include historical works by authors such as Mill, Tocqueville, and Hobson, as well as contemporary works of political theory and the history of political thought (by authors such as James Tully, Michael Ignatieff, David Kennedy, and Uday Mehta).

Many of us would wholeheartedly agree with Aristotle\'s assertion that social relationships are what make life worth living. Indeed, our greatest moments in life and our most treasured memories are inextricably linked to close friends and family members, from holiday dinners to birthday bashes. But, it is also the case that close relationships are also the source of some of our darkest moments. After all, romantic relationships dissolve, family members become estranged, and friendships fail. As rewarding as social relationships can be, sometimes they just plain hurt. Given the complexity of navigating the social world, how do we maintain a sense of social belonging in the face of social threats? In this advanced seminar we\'ll tackle this very question, drawing primarily from a burgeoning literature in social psychology. In the first part of the course, we\'ll learn about the psychological and physiological benefits of maintaining close social ties and we\'ll study the major theories that discuss how we may regulate this core social need. In the second part of the course, we\'ll examine empirical evidence relevant to each of these theories by examining how people respond to social threats at a physiological, neurological, cognitive, and behavioral level',

This course prepares students to understand scholarly articles using these four methods. We use a case analysis approach teaching specific decision algorithms in the application of the four methods.

Public policy analysts use logistic and linear regression to build models that help them understand, and thus change, the world. In preparation for building these models, factor analysis is a tool to identify underlying patterns in the data and reduce its complexity. Cluster analysis permits segmenting the policy audience, as a guide to better targeting of interventions. In this course students select a dataset of interest to them and analyze it using these four methods, preparing the "findings" sections suitable for publication and/or BA papers. They also prepare a PowerPoint presentation suitable for either a policy or academic audience. Guest speakers from the University who have published articles using these methods discuss the practical issues in undertaking quantitative research.

Public policies intended to upset such traditions have included forced busing, affirmative action, the reservation of opportunities and political positions for specific castes/religions/ethnicities, and the legislated illegality of discrimination in housing and employment. Most recently in the United States, through distraction, hopelessness, indifference, neglect, the absence of good ideas, and/or the inability of advocates to compete effectively in the policy landscape, public policy has little to say about race.\xa0 Even an African-American president has declined to offer policy initiatives in this area. This course will examine public policy attempts to address issues of race, explore why so many seem to contain the seeds of their own failure, and formulate potential race policies that could jump start the contemporary policy conversation in this area.\xa0 The course will include a research component exploring the current status of race policy in Chicago and Hyde Park',

                                         'desc': u'One of the most innovative and original writers of twentieth-century Italy, Elsa Morante (1912-1985) did not enjoy canonization and full integration into the modern Italian novel tradition during her life. From the late 1940s to her death, her works stimulated numerous critical debates, but she remained fundamentally an \u201coutsider\u201d whose art could not find a comfortable place in the prevailing niches into which her more \u201cinsider\u201d contemporaries were placed. In this course we shall read and analyze in detail her novels and essays, and consider the earlier and more recent critical reception of her corpus. We shall also consider her influence on subsequent writers, and the ways in which her poetics and practice interact in important ways with feminist, queer, and political theories of current interest. Given that her major novels are translated into English, the course is open to non-specialists of Italian literature, although students concentrating on Italian literature will read the original versions',

It will focus on some of the Brazilian writers who have exerted a permanent influence upon different literary generations and who are considered a key source of inspiration for contemporary Brazilian fiction writing, such as Manuel Antonio de Almeida, Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis, Lima Barreto, Graciliano Ramos and Clarice Lispector, as well as on contemporary authors, such as Jo\xe3o Gilberto Noll, Milton Hatoum, Bernardo Carvalho, Ana Miranda, Crist\xf3v\xe3o Tezza and Adriana Lisboa. The instructor being a novelist himself will make himself available for discussing, in one of the classes, his own work in the context of the Brazilian contemporary fiction writing. Students are encouraged to see a few Brazilian films based on the novels studied during the course, by directors Joaquim Pedro de Andrade, Andr\xe9 Klotzel, Leon Hiszman, Nelson Pereira dos Santos and Suzana Amaral. The Brazilian Writer-in-Residence for the Midwest 2011 (still to be chosen) will be invited to one of the classes. Taught in English.

Was poetry a disciplinary tool for the formation of notions of citizenship and of civic values? Through a series of close textual readings, we will investigate the nature of the entanglement between the poetical and the demands of the political and inquire if there were moments when this relationship proved to be traversed by frictions, if not impossibilities.

We will examine the interaction between Marxism, state power and image culture by focusing on key moments from the entire lifespan of the USSR (1917\u20131991) and from across the range of media,from graphic art and film to their reflections in literature and aesthetic theory. In addition to class readings and discussions, we will be able to engage directly with a vast array of material at exhibits of graphic art (three on campus, three more across the city) and film series that will be conducted in fall 2011 as part of the city-wide Soviet Arts Experience',

However it does suggest (perhaps surprisingly) that from the very beginning cinema was seen as a means of visualizing the non-rational, uncanny and even invisible. This course examines the relationship between symbolism and cinema with particular attention to French and Russian writings and films. Examining how symbolist aesthetics became applied to the cinematic medium, we will pay particular attention the resources it provided for conceptualizing the uncanny and the mystical. We will question whether there exists a distinct symbolist tradition in film history and how it relates to notions of poetic or experimental cinema. Films will represent a broad cross-section of European (and some American) cinema, from Jean Epstein to Sergei Eisenstein and Alexander Dovzhenko, and from Stan Brakhage to Andrei Tarkovsky',

We also think about differing models of masculinity, the figure of the gypsy as a metaphor for the national self in relation to the West, and the myths Balkans tell about themselves. We conclude by considering the role that the imperative to belong to Western Europe played in the Yugoslav wars of succession. Some possible texts/films are Ivo Andric, Bosnian Chronicle; Aleko Konstantinov, Baj Ganyo; Emir Kusturica, Underground; and Milcho Manchevski, Before the Rain',

We then look at the narrative of original wholeness, loss, and redemption through which Balkan countries retell their Ottoman past. With the help of Freud's analysis of masochistic desire and \u017di\u017eek's theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we contemplate the national fixation on the trauma of loss and the dynamic between victimhood and sublimity. The figure of the Janissary highlights the significance of the other in the definition of the self. Some possible texts are Petar Njego\u0161's Mountain Wreath; Ismail Kadare's The Castle; and Anton Donchev's Time of Parting",

In that time, there was hardly an aspect of life that was not profoundly influenced by social class. In the ensuing period, the effects of social class have receded greatly, and perhaps have even vanished. In their place formal schooling has become the great generalized influence over who gets access to the desiderata of social life, including food, shelter, political power, and medical care. So it is that schooling is sociologically interesting for reasons that go well beyond education. The purpose of this course is to review what is known about the long-term effects of schooling",

These various functions of urban culture do not easily combine in cohesive development strategies, often causing interest conflicts and public contestation.

This course explores how Hindi literature of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries engaged with the "women\'s question." Caught between middle class conservatism and the urge for social reform, Hindi authors thematized controversial issues (e.g., female education, child marriage, widow remarriage, prostitution) in their fictional and discursive writings. We explore the tensions of a literary and social agenda that advocated the "uplift" of women as a necessary precondition for the progress of the nation, while also expressing patriarchal fears about women\'s rights and freedom.

The course explores the city of Mumbai through an urban-culturalist perspective and problematizes the ways in which the built environment of the city: its transportation, streets, slums, neighborhoods, tenements, markets, malls and businesses animate and are animated by the everyday life and politics in the metropolis. It encourages students to think about the ways in which Mumbai\u2019s past and present patterns of urban informality, capitalism, consumption, criminality and urban dislocations mediate very particular experiences of politics, sociality, class, gender and globalization.

Probability is developed for the purpose of modeling outcomes of random phenomena. Random variables and their expectations are studied; including means and variances of linear combinations and an introduction to conditional expectation. Binomial, Poisson, normal and other standard probability distributions are considered. Some probability models are studied mathematically, and others are studied via simulation on a computer. Sampling distributions and related statistical methods are explored mathematically, studied via simulation, and illustrated on data. Methods include, but are not limited to, inference for means and variances for one- and two-sample problems, correlation, and simple linear regression. Graphical description and numerical data description are used for exploration, communication of results, and comparing mathematical consequences of probability models and data. Mathematics employed is to the level of univariate calculus, but it is less demanding than that required by STAT 24400',

What can Beckett\u2019s experiments teach us about the presumed and actual limits of form? What can we learn from Beckett\u2019s career about the cardinal developments in twentieth-century drama, literature, film and television?

Our consideration of these works will be augmented by a series of critical essays on the limits of representation, the problematics of mediation and aesthetic adequation, the possibilities of commemoration, and the promises of aesthetic resistance.  In addition, we will consider a number of theoretical works on the operations of cinematic identification and narrative comprehension that are important to an understanding of the formal operations of film, theater, and poetry.  The course will be conducted in English and no fluency in German or the languages of cultural and film criticism is required.  However, it is designed for graduates and advanced undergraduates who have a particular interest in (and, ideally, are familiar with) some combination of cultural theory, aesthetic theory, and/or film theory; those who possess no knowledge of any of these fields should consult the instructor before signing up for the course',
